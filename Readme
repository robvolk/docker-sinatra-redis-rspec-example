## Getting Started
1. Launch the Docker Quickstart Terminal app
2. Build & run the image: `docker-compose up`

## Run the tests
`docker-compose run --rm app bundle exec rspec spec`


## Re-build the image
When you change the Dockerfile or Gemfile, you'll want to rebuild the image like so:
`docker-compose build`


NEXT
1. see if we can create a "test" container that's always running with test environment settings.  then configure rubytest to execute commands against the running container so it's speedy (using docker's exec command).


## TODO
why's it not updating gemfile.lock?
